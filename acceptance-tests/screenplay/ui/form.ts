/**
 * The identity pages' form, as a **Lean Page Object**: it locates elements and reports what they
 * say. It never asserts, never exposes the driver, and returns no tasks — behaviour lives in the
 * screenplay tasks that use it.
 *
 * Fields are found by their visible `<label>`, not by id, so a locator reads the way the scenario
 * does ("Email address") and survives a rename of the underlying control. That lookup is safe to
 * rely on because `make lint-accessibility` fails the build if any input loses its `<label for>`.
 *
 * The class names below (`.field__error`) belong to the single shared `app-text-field` component
 * rather than to page styling, so there is exactly one place they can change.
