# Advanced Web Application Architecture

## How to Use This Skill

- **Without arguments** — load the core frameworks below for reference
- **With a topic** — ask about `validation`, `read models`, `ports and adapters`, or anything in the Topic Index; I'll read the relevant chapter
- **With a chapter** — ask for `ch06`; I'll load that chapter file
- **Browse** — ask "what chapters do you have?"

When you ask about a topic not covered below, I will read the relevant chapter file before answering.

## Core Frameworks & Mental Models

### The Two Rules for Core Code (Ch 1)
The book's foundation. Code is **core** only if it passes **both**:

1. **No dependencies on external systems** — "nor does it depend on code written for interacting with a specific type of external system."
2. **No special context needed** — "nor does it have dependencies that are designed to run in a specific context only."

Anything else is **infrastructure code**. The second clause of each rule is the subtle one: an interface named `Connection` with `insert(string $table, array $data)` is still infrastructure, because the signature only makes sense for relational databases.

### The Two-Step Abstraction Recipe (Ch 1)
1. Introduce an interface.
2. **Communicate *purpose* instead of implementation details.**

Step 2 is what people skip. `Connection::insert($table, $data)` → `Repository::save(Member $member)`. Same indirection; only the second one decouples.

### The Strategy, in Two Principles (Ch 9)
Everything in Part I reduces to:
1. **Use dependency injection everywhere; let services depend on abstractions only.**
2. **Make use cases independent of the delivery mechanism of their input.**

These map onto the two actor types: (1) decouples from **secondary actors** (database, APIs, clock), (2) from **primary actors** (browser, CLI, cron, tests).

**The architectural invariant**: every dependency arrow stays inside the core, or points from infrastructure *into* the core. Never outward.

### Where Each Input Goes (Ch 5, 11)
- **Dependencies** (services) → constructor arguments
- **Configuration values** → constructor arguments, with an assertion
- **Contextual information** → method arguments (the tell is the word "current")
- **Job-specific data** → method arguments, ideally a command object

Injecting `ContainerInterface` is *not* dependency injection — it passes Rule 1 but fails Rule 2.

### Object-Pure Code (Ch 5, 9)
> "The result of calling a method on an object should be determined by its own implementation logic, and optionally by the behavior of one of its constructor arguments, or the method arguments provided to it; and nothing more."

**Impurity is transitive through concrete dependencies.** Injecting a concrete `Timer` doesn't help — calling it inevitably calls `time()`. Only an *interface* breaks the chain.

### Prefer Protection over Validation (Ch 8)
> "We don't assign a value to a property, then validate it; we protect the object from ending up in an incorrect state."

Objects must prevent **incomplete**, **invalid**, and **inconsistent** state, plus illegal **state transitions**. Push each rule into a value object — then a typed parameter *is* proof that validation happened. Validate with **pure functions only**.

### Write Model / Read Model Separation (Ch 3)
> "A client that needs an object for getting information from should not retrieve the same object as clients that want to make changes to it."

A getter appearing on an entity means you loaded it just to read. **Read models return value objects; view models return render-ready primitives.** Design each backwards from its client — the calling code, or the template.

### The CLI Thought Experiment (Ch 3)
"If the business ran from the command line, would the application still need this functionality?"
- **No** → it was justifiably tied to infrastructure. Leave it.
- **Yes** → it must be decoupled and represented in core code.

### The Abstraction Test (Ch 6)
> "It's a good abstraction if it is still useful when the implementation details change radically."

Explicitly **not** "if you can create a test double for it." Extracting an interface *from* a vendor's API client changes nothing — the vendor's method names, parameters, and return types survive. Find the abstraction by writing the call you *wish* existed, in your own domain's words.

### Design Ownership (Ch 7)
> "The classes you use as dependencies (constructor arguments, method arguments and return types) in your domain model should also be designed by you."

Third-party classes are built for *any* use case. Use them *inside* your value objects for heavy lifting; never in the public API.

### Ports and Adapters (Ch 13)
A **port** is an intention of communication (name it by completing "for …"); an **adapter** is its implementation, including all collaborating code — the ORM, the framework, the web server. **Test code is an adapter.**

The asymmetry: outgoing adapters **implement** the port interface; incoming adapters **use** it (`ApplicationInterface` or a `CommandBus`).

### Layers and the Dependency Rule (Ch 12)
Domain / Application / Infrastructure, with **interfaces inward, implementations outward**. "Source code dependencies should only point inwards." Express layers as namespaces; enforce with `deptrac`.

### The Testing Strategy (Ch 14)
> "A test is not a unit test if it invokes infrastructure code."

- **Unit tests** — entities and value objects only
- **Use case tests** — the hexagon, via a hand-written test container with in-memory repositories and spies
- **Adapter tests** — contract tests (outgoing) and driving tests (incoming)
- **End-to-end tests** — a few, black-box

Never unit-test controllers, application services, subscribers, or repository implementations.

### Just-Right-Engineering (Ch 15)
> "If you feel like core and infrastructure deserve to be apart, doing that extra work can't be considered over-engineering. It's rather *just-right-engineering*."

Most web applications are *under*-engineered. But: small infrastructural scripts and genuine CRUD apps don't need this — and automated testing is never optional regardless.

## Scope & Limits

This skill covers the book's content only. Examples are PHP (Symfony/Laravel/Doctrine idioms), but the principles are language-agnostic. For hands-on implementation in your codebase, combine with project-specific tools.
