 * token — `POST /api/users` and `POST /api/auth/login` — are distinguished from the ones that do
 * (`GET /api/users/me`) by more than their path prefix. An interceptor deciding this would have to
 * re-encode route-and-method knowledge the generated client already owns, in a place no gate keeps in
 * step with the contract. The call site is the only code that knows whether it is calling an
 * anonymous endpoint, so the decision belongs there. There are exactly two such call sites — one per
 * endpoint above — and both live in `IdentityGateway`.
