This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Monorepo integration

An Angular 21 app (project `nmk-frontend`), one subproject of a monorepo. **Read the root
`../CLAUDE.md` for the cross-cutting picture**; this section covers only how the frontend plugs in.

Everything runs in Docker via the `Makefile` — a single `app` service defined in `docker-compose.yml`
(Compose project `nmk-frontend`), built from the `Dockerfile` (`node:22-bookworm-slim`). The Makefile
speaks the monorepo's shared vocabulary, so the root Makefile's fan-out targets reach it:

- `make up` / `make down` — start/stop the dev server (`ng serve`, http://localhost:4200), `up` waits until it serves.
- `make lint` / `make fix-lint` — ESLint (`ng lint`); the bare target is read-only, `fix-` writes.
- `make format` / `make fix-format` — Prettier; same read-only/writing split.
- `make run-unit-tests` — Vitest (jsdom), runs once and exits. Wired into the root `run-unit-tests`, so CI gates it.
- `make sh`, `make logs`, `make npm <script>` — shell, logs, and any package.json script in the container.

Each check runs in a throwaway container (`docker compose run --rm app npm run <script>`) needing
nothing else up — no Node install, no browser (Vitest uses jsdom). That is what lets CI run every gate
with no setup and no secrets. Make targets are verb-object hyphenated (`fix-format`); the wrapped
package.json scripts keep the colon (`format:fix`).

The frontend rides the root's existing `lint`/`format`/`run-unit-tests` fan-out, so CI covers it with
no workflow change. A _new kind_ of check would also need a root target, a CI job, and a
`run-guardrails` line — see `../CLAUDE.md`.

## Angular & TypeScript best practices

You are an expert in TypeScript, Angular, and scalable web application development. You write functional, maintainable, performant, and accessible code following Angular and TypeScript best practices.

### TypeScript Best Practices

- Use strict type checking
- Prefer type inference when the type is obvious
- Avoid the `any` type; use `unknown` when type is uncertain

### Angular Best Practices

- Always use standalone components over NgModules
- Must NOT set `standalone: true` inside Angular decorators. It's the default in Angular v20+.
- Use signals for state management
- Implement lazy loading for feature routes
- Do NOT use the `@HostBinding` and `@HostListener` decorators. Put host bindings inside the `host` object of the `@Component` or `@Directive` decorator instead
- Use `NgOptimizedImage` for all static images.
  - `NgOptimizedImage` does not work for inline base64 images.

### Accessibility Requirements

- It MUST pass all AXE checks.
- It MUST follow all WCAG AA minimums, including focus management, color contrast, and ARIA attributes.

### Components

- Keep components small and focused on a single responsibility
- Use `input()` and `output()` functions instead of decorators
- Use `computed()` for derived state
- Set `changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush` in `@Component` decorator
- Prefer inline templates for small components
- Prefer Reactive forms instead of Template-driven ones
- Do NOT use `ngClass`, use `class` bindings instead
- Do NOT use `ngStyle`, use `style` bindings instead
- When using external templates/styles, use paths relative to the component TS file.

### State Management

- Use signals for local component state
- Use `computed()` for derived state
- Keep state transformations pure and predictable
- Do NOT use `mutate` on signals, use `update` or `set` instead

### Templates

- Keep templates simple and avoid complex logic
- Use native control flow (`@if`, `@for`, `@switch`) instead of `*ngIf`, `*ngFor`, `*ngSwitch`
- Use the async pipe to handle observables
- Do not assume globals like (`new Date()`) are available.

### Services

- Design services around a single responsibility
- Use the `providedIn: 'root'` option for singleton services
- Use the `inject()` function instead of constructor injection
